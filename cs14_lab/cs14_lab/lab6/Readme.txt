Question 1: My selection sort is stable because before swapping my code checks whether
or not the iterators are pointing at the same node and whether
or not the values at the iterators are equal which make sure they are not swapped
making it stable.

Question 2: By using pairs with the same value as their first element and 
comparing them, I was able to determine that the sorting algortihm is stable.
